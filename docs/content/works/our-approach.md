:::

## Core Animation Principles

We adhere to the 12 fundamental principles of animation in all our work:

1. **Squash and Stretch** - Giving objects weight and flexibility
2. **Anticipation** - Preparing the audience for an action
3. **Staging** - Presenting ideas clearly through composition
4. **Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose** - Different approaches to the animation process
5. **Follow Through & Overlapping Action** - Creating natural movement extensions
6. **Slow In & Slow Out** - Giving acceleration and deceleration to movements
7. **Arcs** - Following natural arc trajectories in movement
8. **Secondary Action** - Adding supporting actions to enhance the main action
9. **Timing** - Establishing character and emotion through movement speed
10. **Exaggeration** - Accentuating actions for dramatic effect
11. **Solid Drawing** - Understanding form in three-dimensional space
12. **Appeal** - Creating engaging and captivating characters and movements
